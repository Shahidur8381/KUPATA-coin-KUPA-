              Kupata Coin ($KUPA) is a community-driven meme token inspired by the heartwarming legacy of Kupata, 
              the iconic stray dog from Batumi, Georgia. Known for his gentle kindness and selfless act of guiding 
              pedestrians across busy streets, Kupata touched hearts worldwide until his passing in 2023.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              In his honor, $KUPA blends viral meme culture with real-world impact: raising funds to support stray 
              animal welfare globally through partnerships with verified NGOs like the Humane Society International 
              and local shelters. Every transaction contributes to a brighter future for strays, turning memes into 
              meaningful change. This is a legitimate project with transparent audits, locked liquidity, and audited 
              smart contracts on Ethereum (ERC-20) for security and accessibility.
